### Project Goal
Predict 2017-18 TEA accountability scores

### Summary
The following project includes a written preliminary analysis of the relationship between TEA accountability scores and variables like poverty, STAAR test scores, and attendance. This analysis served as a foundation for predicting 2017-18 TEA accountability scores using random forest and multiple regression machine learning models. 

### Results
In the initial machine learning models, the more complex random forest model performed better than the less complex, multiple regression model. The higher the MAE, mean square error, MSE, mean square error, and RMSE, root mean square error, the worse the model. Errors for the two models are listed below.

Random Forest
MAE: 5.24 points, MSE: 58.02, RMSE: 7.62 points

Multiple Regression
MAE: 11.42 points, MSE: 202.06, RMSE: 14.21 points

Variable importance from the random forest model:
Instructional expenditure ratio, Percent economically disadvantaged of enrolled, Enrollment in 9th grade percent, Attendance all percent
Enrollment Disciplinary Alternative Education Program percent, All school leadership function percent, All percent local tax, Teacher turnover percent, Enrolled mobile percent, Campus administrative salary percent

### Included
Original research paper and additional predictive model research

### Programs
R, SAS, Python
